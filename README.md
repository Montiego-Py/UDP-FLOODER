# Montiego-Py
Very basic DOS attack made with python.

It can be converted into a DDOS attack using multiple computers.

I'm not responsible for the use you give using this program.

It Supports UDP and TCP

Usage
download or copy the script of rundos.sh

Maybe you should do it to make it work.

chmod +x setup.sh
Auto-Install Script
wget -O ddos.sh 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Montiego-Py/UDP-FLOODER/setup.sh' && chmod +x ddos.sh && ./ddos.sh
After running this code and want to open it again just do:

./ddos.sh
And if you want an auto-update bash script (I don't think it would be updated too much) take the Auto-Install Script and put it inside a .sh file

Windows
If you are on windows install Python3 and download the script udpflood.py open a powershell window or cmd

python3 main.py
